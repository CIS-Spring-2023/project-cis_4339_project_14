### Services Front-end demonstration (Sprint 2)
To demonstrate frontend functionality of the Services, Service Intake, and Services offered when creating an event, follow these steps:

1. Create a new service Front the Service Intake form. NOTE: ALL SERVICES ARE CREATED AS AN INACTIVE SERVICE
2. Go to the Services Page.
3. The Services that the user added will now be listed in the table at the top. NOTE: ALL SERVICES ARE CREATED AS INACTTIVE
4. Edit a Service Status by inputting which service you want to change, which property you want to change , and the new value (in the case of status it's either Active/Inactive). NOTE: ALL THESE ARE CASE SENSITIVE
